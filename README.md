This R notebook shows the word cloud visualization of the Apple Apps Description. This word cloud was created using the Mobile Store Apps Dataset found in Kaggle under [Ramanathan](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps).

To find the most used words in the app descriptions, I referenced these two articles:

1.    [dkmathstats](https://dk81.github.io/dkmathstats_site/rtext-freq-words.html)  Finding the most frequent words in text with R
2.    [Celine Van den Rul](https://towardsdatascience.com/create-a-word-cloud-with-r-bde3e7422e8a)  How to generate word clouds in R

For the analysis of the Mobile Apps, I used Kaggle. You can find the notebook in this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/estherwimenje/apple-ios-mobile-apps)
